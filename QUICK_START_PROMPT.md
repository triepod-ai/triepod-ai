# Triepod.AI Development Prompt - Copy This for New Sessions

```
I need to work on the Triepod.AI website as an expert web designer and full-stack developer. 

Project location: \\wsl.localhost\Debian\home\bryan\_websites\triepod.ai

Please read the comprehensive prompt at WEB_DESIGN_EXPERT_PROMPT.md which includes:
- Technical stack details (Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- Information security requirements (proprietary methodology protection)
- Mandatory tracking requirements (MUST update DEVELOPMENT_TRACKING.md)
- Current project status and next steps

Key requirements:
1. NEVER reveal the proprietary methodology - focus on results ($16K value, 85% success rate)
2. ALWAYS update DEVELOPMENT_TRACKING.md before ending the session
3. Follow existing design patterns and component architecture
4. Test with npm run build before committing changes

The project helps democratize access to justice through AI-powered discrimination case support.
```
